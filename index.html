<h1>Jekk Tales</h1>
<p>Jekk slowly roams around an empty field as one of his activities.</p>
<br>
  <p>Jekk stumbles on a rock while he was exploring.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Jekk destroys rock as because it was imperfect to exist.</p>
  <br>
  <p>After Jekk destroys the imperfect rock, he continues to roam around the vast empty field when he stumbles a mysterious stranger.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The stranger asks Jekk, "Do you want a rock?". Jekk is filled with hatred because the rock the stranger was holding was imperfect as well</p>
  <br>
  <p>Jekk proceeds to eat the stranger as the stranger shows him the rock that Jekk thinks, "Imperfect is a sin". The End.</p>
